    Blacksmith gave his apprentice a task to make many rings. The apprentice is not skilled yet and as result
    some (many) rings are connected. But we need separated rings and now we should decide how we can break some rings
    to free the maximum rings as it possible.
</p>

<p>
    All rings are numbered and you are given an information which rings are connected.
    The information is given as a sequence of sets. Each sets describe connected rings.
    For example {1, 2} means that 1st and 2nd rings are connected.
    You should count how many rings we should break to get the maximum of separated rings.
    All rings are numbered from 1 to N, where N is quantity of rings.

</p>

<p>
    In the image you can see the next connections: ({1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{4,5},{4,6},{6,5}).
    And the best way is to break 3 rings -- 3 rings will be full and separated. So the result is 3.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> An information about ring connections as a tuple of sets with integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> How many rings we should break for the best result as an integer.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This model can show how "strong" your network or roads between cities.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    all(len(s) == 2 for s in rings)<br>
    sorted(reduce(set.union, rings)) == list(range(1, max(reduce(set.union, rings)) + 1))<br>
